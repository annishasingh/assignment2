	<p>In the past few years there have been multiple ongoing wars across the globe. Regardless of the circumstances, war continues to break out and countries continue to spend high amounts on military expenditures. 
	
	<p>This data came from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has been collecting military spending data since 1949.
	
	<p>When mapping the data, a common trend appeared. Countries that exert their influence on others maintained a consistent high rate of military spending over the 20 year period.

	<p> This chart represents the average of U.S. dollars each country spent in billions, then divided into millions and rounded to the nearest hundredth from the years 2004 to 2013.

	<p> Based on the finding the United States has been the nation that invests the most into military funding amounting to almost $880.9 billion dollars during a 10 year duration.

	<p> China followed behind at $122.3 billion, along with Saudi Arabia at almost $100 billion. The United Kingdom spent $65.4 billion with Russia following closely behind at 54.9 billion, then India at 48.3 billion and lastly France 48.1 billion.

	<p> Also spending a heavy amount behind these countries were Canada, Australia and Brazil Italy and Germany Spain.

	<p> These are countries that are often put at the forefront regarding global situations, and they continue to be the ones that are still spending the most on military expenses.

<div style="min-height:444px" id="datawrapper-vis-VGrgR"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VGrgR/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-VGrgR"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VGrgR/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

	<p> The second map shows the years 2014 to 2023 and it shows more than just military expenditure. This data represents the influence these countries have on a global scale in more than one way, for example economically and socially. 


	<p> Similar to the first map America spent the most on military funds $826.4 billion. Again, China followed with $252 billion. 

	<p> Russia spent 87 billion, Saudi Arabia 76.3 billion, and India 71.6 billion. It doesn’t stop there, the United Kingdom spent 61.4 billion, France 51.4 billion, Japan 43.1 billion and lastly South Korea 41.6 billion. 

	<p> Both maps represent a subtle shift in global spending. Comparing the statistics in both maps show although the same countries continue to invest more into their military there has been a decrease in how much they’re spending. 

	<p> Russia’s spending increased due to the war which started in 2022 and is still going on till today. 

	<p> Another significant increase was Israel's spending going up by at $5.8 billion increase compared to both decades. 

	<p> This data says a lot about what’s happening in the world and indicates what countries hold significant power. 

	<p> Based on current events and the escalation of the conflict in Israel and Gaza, one prediction that could be made is an even bigger increase in spending from Israel.
